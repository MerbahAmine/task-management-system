##Time Allocation Breakdown:

Days 1â€“2: I faced technical issues with my PC, which delayed my start. To stay committed, I invested in a new machine specifically to continue this project.
Remaining days: Focused on implementing the required features, troubleshooting errors, and researching solutions to technical challenges.

##Technical Challenges Faced:

Docker: Setting up and managing containers was complex. I spent time learning from multiple resources to overcome this.
Celery: Configuring and running background tasks was challenging, but I improved by experimenting and researching best practices.

##Trade-offs Made:

I focused more on learning and gaining knowledge than on rushing to complete everything. My priority was to grow through the process. I am very eager to join your team, start this internship, and continue developing myself to become a strong Junior Backend Developer.

##With additional time, I would:

Implement the advanced features I skipped.
Conduct deeper research and improve documentation.
Refactor the codebase for better structure and scalability.
Ensure full functionality from A to Z with polished features and best practices.
Justification for Using Django Templates for the Frontend
I used Django templates as they provided a simple and effective solution for rendering the frontend. This approach allowed me to focus on backend logic while still delivering a functional user interface without requiring a separate frontend framework.
