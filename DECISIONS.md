##Features Completed and Why:

I focused on completing the core mandatory features (Part A), as they were essential for the project evaluation. I prioritized these features to demonstrate solid understanding of fundamentals and proper time management.

##Features Skipped and Why:

Some advanced features (Part B) were skipped due to my current level of expertise. I intentionally left them out because I want to learn them directly during this internship. I believe working with your team will allow me to grow and master these advanced concepts.

##Time Allocation Breakdown:

Days 1â€“2: I faced technical issues with my PC, which delayed my start. To stay committed, I invested in a new machine specifically to continue this project.
Remaining days: Focused on implementing the required features, troubleshooting errors, and researching solutions to technical challenges.

##Technical Challenges Faced:

Docker: Setting up and managing containers was complex. I spent time learning from multiple resources to overcome this.
Celery: Configuring and running background tasks was challenging, but I improved by experimenting and researching best practices.

##Trade-offs Made:

I chose to prioritize stability and core functionality over advanced optimizations. This allowed me to deliver a working project within the given timeframe rather than risk incomplete implementations.

##With additional time, I would:

Implement the advanced features I skipped.
Conduct deeper research and improve documentation.
Refactor the codebase for better structure and scalability.
Ensure full functionality from A to Z with polished features and best practices.
Justification for Using Django Templates for the Frontend
I used Django templates as they provided a simple and effective solution for rendering the frontend. This approach allowed me to focus on backend logic while still delivering a functional user interface without requiring a separate frontend framework.
